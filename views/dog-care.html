      <h2>General Dog Care</h2>
      <p>Taking care of a dog involves providing for their physical, emotional, and social needs. Here are some general guidelines to ensure your dog remains happy and healthy.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Nutrition
          <ul>
            <li> Provide a balanced diet suited to your dog’s age, size, and health. Opt for high-quality commercial dog food or consult your vet for homemade diet recommendations.
              Fresh water should be accessible at all times.
              Avoid feeding your dog harmful human foods such as chocolate, grapes, and onions.
              Regularly monitor your dog's weight and adjust their diet to prevent obesity.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Exercise
          <ul>
            <li>Regular exercise is crucial for your dog’s health. Daily walks, playtime, and interactive toys help maintain physical fitness and mental stimulation.
              Tailor the level of exercise to your dog’s breed, age, and energy levels.
              Activities like fetch, agility training, and obedience training can provide additional stimulation.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Grooming
          <ul>
            <li>Brush your dog regularly to remove loose fur and prevent matting. The frequency of brushing depends on your dog's coat type.
              Bathe your dog as needed using dog-specific shampoo to maintain skin and coat health.
              Trim your dog’s nails regularly to prevent overgrowth and discomfort.
              Brush your dog’s teeth several times a week to prevent dental issues.
              Check and clean your dog’s ears to avoid infections.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Health Care
          <ul>
            <li> Schedule regular veterinary check-ups for vaccinations, parasite control, and overall health assessments.
              Keep up with flea, tick, and heartworm prevention as recommended by your veterinarian.
              Be vigilant for signs of illness, such as changes in appetite, behavior, or energy levels, and consult your vet if you notice anything unusual.
              Consider spaying or neutering your dog to prevent health issues and unwanted litters.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Training and Socialization
          <ul>
            <li>Begin training early using positive reinforcement techniques. Consistent training helps your dog learn good behavior and commands.
              Socialize your dog with different people, environments, and other animals to build their confidence and reduce anxiety.
              Address behavioral issues promptly. Seek professional help if necessary to ensure your dog is well-behaved and well-adjusted.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Safety
          <ul>
            <li>
              Keep your dog on a leash in public areas to ensure their safety.
              Ensure your dog has proper identification, such as a microchip and a collar with an ID tag.
              Create a safe space at home where your dog can retreat and relax.
              Avoid leaving your dog in hot cars, even for short periods, to prevent heatstroke.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
