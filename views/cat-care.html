      <h2>General Cat Care</h2>
      <p>Caring for a cat involves meeting their dietary, physical, and emotional needs. Here are some essential guidelines to ensure your cat leads a healthy and happy life.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Nutrition
          <ul>
            <li>Provide a balanced diet appropriate for your cat’s age, health, and activity level. High-quality commercial cat food is recommended, and your vet can offer guidance on any specific dietary needs.</li>
            <li>Ensure fresh water is always available.</li>
            <li>Avoid feeding your cat harmful human foods like chocolate, onions, and garlic.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Exercise
          <ul>
            <li>Encourage daily play to keep your cat physically and mentally stimulated. Use toys that mimic prey, such as feather wands and laser pointers.</li>
            <li>Provide scratching posts and climbing structures to satisfy natural instincts and keep them active.</li>
            <li>Rotate toys regularly to maintain your cat’s interest and provide mental stimulation.</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Grooming
          <ul>
            <li>Regular brushing helps reduce shedding and prevent hairballs. The frequency of brushing depends on your cat’s coat type.</li>
            <li>Bathe your cat only when necessary, using cat-specific shampoo.</li>
            <li>Trim your cat’s nails regularly to prevent overgrowth and damage to furniture.</li>
            <li>Brush your cat’s teeth several times a week to prevent dental issues.</li>
            <li>Check and clean your cat’s ears to avoid infections.</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Health Care
          <ul>
            <li>Schedule regular veterinary check-ups for vaccinations and health assessments.</li>
            <li>Maintain a routine for flea and tick prevention as recommended by your veterinarian.</li>
            <li>Monitor for signs of illness, such as changes in appetite, litter box habits, or behavior, and consult your vet if you notice anything unusual.</li>
            <li>Consider spaying or neutering your cat to prevent health issues and unwanted litters.</li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Litter Box Maintenance
          <ul>
            <li>Provide a clean, accessible litter box for your cat. Scoop the litter box daily and change the litter regularly.</li>
            <li>Ensure you have one more litter box than the number of cats in your home to avoid territorial issues.</li>
            <li>Place litter boxes in quiet, private areas to encourage use.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Safety
          <ul>
            <li>Keep your cat indoors to protect them from outdoor hazards such as traffic, predators, and diseases.</li>
            <li>Ensure your cat has proper identification, such as a microchip and a collar with an ID tag.</li>
            <li>Create a safe and stimulating environment with places to climb, hide, and explore.</li>
            <li>Be cautious with windows and balconies, ensuring they are secure to prevent falls.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
